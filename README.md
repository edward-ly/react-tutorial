# React Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple tic-tac-toe web game developed as an exercise for learning to develop with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The initial commits follow the official React tutorial which can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html).

### [Play Game](https://edward-ly.github.io/react-tutorial)

## Technical Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). For a guide on how to setup and develop your own React App, you can find the most recent version [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Getting Started

> This app uses [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) to manage development dependencies, so install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if necessary.

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm start`.

```shell
$ git clone <this repo>
$ cd <project folder>
$ npm start
```

This will install dependencies and start the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the app to `gh-pages`, change the `homepage` URL in `package.json` to the root URL of your app (`https://<your-username>.github.io/<app-name>`), and then run `npm run deploy`.

For more details or for more deployment options, refer to the React development guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment).
