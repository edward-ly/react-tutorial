# React Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple tic-tac-toe web game developed as an exercise for learning to develop with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The initial commits follow the official React tutorial which can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Technical Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). For a guide on how to setup and develop your own React App, you can find the most recent version [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Getting Started

> This app uses [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) to manage development dependencies, so install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if necessary.

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm start`.

```shell
$ git clone <this repo>
$ cd <project folder>
$ npm start
```

This will install dependencies and start the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

To be updated once this app has been deployed.

<!-- To deploy the app to `gh-pages`, first install `gh-pages` with `npm install --save gh-pages` if you haven't already, and then run:

```shell
$ npm run build
$ gh-pages -d build
```

For more details or for more deployment options, refer to the React development guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment). -->
